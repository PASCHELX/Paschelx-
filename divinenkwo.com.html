		<h1>MY STORY</h1>
		<hr    />
		<p>ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢<br>

20th July 2022, almost a year now, I was called for an interview, not for a job opportunity but for a scholarship to study in Netherland. 

Having written the exam and passed in flying colours, I was confident in passing the interview, I was already calculating how I would divide my time between working and schooling, and be sending something to my parents at home.

But guess what happen?

I failed the interview ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­, not because of question related to my field of study, but because of a simple question. The name of my grandparents from both my maternal and paternal side, I could not answer the question, and that was how I failed to secure the scholarship.
 If I had answer that question, I would not have been in this school in Kaduna looking for garri (sorry groceries) to drink.<br>

What am I trying to say?<br>
Try to know more about your roots, many of us know the family of many people in the bible or notable men and women in our country, but how well do you know your family?
Try to answer the question, and tell yourself the truth. Our people used to say that if you know where you are coming from, you would know where you are going to.

Try to know your root. <br>
